# Geographically Weighted Regression Made Easy
## Introducing the Project
This is my web application application for a Geospatial Analytics module that I took at Singapore Management University.
In an effort to bridge the gap between the high demand and low accessibility of geospatial analysis, my team and I created an application that can perform Geographically Weighted Regression Models.<br>
The web app allows users to create geographically weighted regression models without any prior technical knowledge. ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ
