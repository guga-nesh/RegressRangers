# RegressRangers

I am one member of team RegressRangers, a passionate group of individuals who are dedicated to making geospatial analysis easier for the common person. Our goal is to create a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for exploring geospatial data, even for non-technical users. We believe that this information can be incredibly valuable for a wide range of applications, from urban planning to environmental monitoring. We will be specifically focusing on Geographically Weighted Regression Models.

_This is a web application made for a Geospatial Analytics module as part of my undergraduate studies at Singapore Management University._

## Introducing the Project

In an effort to bridge the gap between the high demand and low accessibility of geospatial analysis, my team and I created an application that can perform Geographically Weighted Regression Models. The main value proposition of this web app is that it allows users to create geographically weighted regression models without **any** prior technical knowledge. ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ

This proof-of-concept web-app regresses the COVID-19 vaccination rate in sub-districts within DKI Jakarta. The application allows users to perform Exploratory Data Analysis, Linear Regression using OLS, and Geograhically Weighted Regression. With these features, users can gain important insights into the progress of immunization campaigns and help identify variables that influence vaccine adoption across the different sub-districts in DKI Jakarta.

## Project Website

A project website has been created to explain every single detail about this project. We have included information such as the:

- Project Proposal - information such as the research that went into this project, our methodology and our application storyboard.
- Final Application - a user guide to our application and a poster explains the entire project in a concise manner.
- Project Research Paper - our research paper that delves deep into the specific details of the processes taken to solve the problem statement. Please refer to this for a detailed and technical write-up on this project.
