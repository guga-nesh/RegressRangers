    "text": "OverviewDataLiterature ReviewMethodologyR PackagesApplication StoryboardTimelineReferencesContact Information\n\n\n\nProblem Statement\nMany real-world phenomena exhibit significant spatial variability, and traditional regression models that assume spatial homogeneity fail to capture the underlying patterns in the data set collected. Geographically weighted regression models are an effective way to address this problem by allowing for local variation in the relationship between the response variable and the predictor variables. However, creating accurate geographically weighted regression models can be a complex and time-consuming process that requires specialized knowledge and software. Additionally, evaluating the performance of these models can be challenging due to the local nature of the models.\n\n\nCase Study\nAnalysing vaccination rates is crucial in the current climate as the world is grappling with a global pandemic caused by COVID-19. Vaccination üíâ is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and protect communities from illness and death. With the availability of COVID-19 vaccination data, we can gain important insights into the progress of immunization campaigns and help identify areas where more resources and efforts are needed to increase vaccine uptake. Additionally, analyzing vaccination rates can inform public health policies and interventions aimed at improving vaccine distribution, accessibility, and equity, particularly for vulnerable populations who may face barriers to vaccination.\nWe will be using the above-mentioned case study to design and test our geospatial analytics tool üòÉ\n\n\nKey Objectives\nOur project aims to create a web-based geospatial analytics tool that helps users create and evaluate geographical regression models easily by:\n\nimporting data üìÅ\nidentifying significant regressors in the model üîç\ncreating customised Linear and Geographically Weighted Models üìà\nevaluating the models based on a variety of statistical tests üß™\n\n\n\n\nTo build and test our application, we will be modeling the vaccination rate of DKI, Jakarta in the various sub-districts based on a variety of socio-economic factors.\n\nTable 1: Datasets used\n\n\nName\nSource\n\n\n\n\nNumber of school facilities\ndata.humdata.org\n\n\nNumber of health care facilities\ndata.humdata.org\n\n\nDKI Jakarta Map Boundary\nindonesia-geospasial.com\n\n\nNumber of COVID-19 cases per sub-district\nriwayat-file-covid-19-dki-jakarta-jakartagis.hub.arcgis.com\n\n\nPopulation density of the various sub-districts in DKI Jakarta (2019)\ndata.jakarta.go.id\n\n\nMale to female ratio of the various sub-districts in DKI Jakarta\nNumber of Elderly in the sub-districts of DKI Jakarta\ndata.jakarta.go.id\n\n\nNumber of Educated people per sub-district\ndata.jakarta.go.id\n\n\nNumber of health workers per sub-district\ndata.jakarta.go.id\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have identified studies that have attempted to perform similar types of analyses:\n\n1.

A geographically weighted regression approach to investigate the effect of traffic conditions and road characteristics on air pollutant emissions\n\nTable 4: Details of Study #3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective\n\nThis study aims to investigate the effects of traffic, road network, employment and social demographic characteristics on air pollutant emissions at the level of traffic analysis zone (TAZ).\nIn deriving an appropriate regression model, the authors also compared the use of geographically weighted regressions and the conventional generalised linear regression model to link pollutant concentrations with various contributory variables.\n\n\n\nMethodology\n\nLinear Regression analysis - if a candidate variable and its quadratic and cubic terms are all insignificant, this variable will not be retained in the GWR models\nPearson Correlation Coefficients were calculated to ensure highly correlated variables were not simultaneously included in the model.\nBest combination of explanatory variables determined by AICc.\nGWR model - used Kriging Interpolation method to get the pollutant concentrations\n\ncorrelation analysis conducted between candidate exploratory variables\n\nUsed 10-fold cross validation of different models to infer how much prediction accuracy increases based on changes made to the model\n\n\n\nKey Learning Points\n\nGWR can effectively overcome the limitation of Generalised Linear Model (GLM) in modeling the pollutant concentrations at the Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) level.\nConstraining the parameters to be constant may lead to biased parameter estimates.\n\n\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\nNIL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Preparation\n\nImport data into R environment\nPerform data wrangling - Kriging Interpolation Method\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nEDA helps users to understand the data distribution, detect outliers, and identify any missing values. This helps us evaluate the that the assumptions of statistical tests are met before performing them. EDA also helps users generate hypotheses that can guide further investigations of the issue at hand.\n\nDraw Histograms\nCreate Choropleth Map\nCheck if statistical test assumptions are met\n\nLinear Regression (OLS)\nPerforming Ordinary Least Squares regression before GWR is important as it provides a globel model for the data. It can help identify overall trends and relationships in the data. By comparing the results of OLS and GWR, users can better understand how relationship between variables vary across space and make more informed decisions.\n\nGeneralised Multiple Linear Regression Method\nStepwise forward regression (focus on covariates with highest increase in \\(R^2\\) and \\((VIF) < 3\\)\nUsing stepwise forward regression helps users identify the most important predictors of a response variable while avoiding overfitting of the model.\n\nGeographically Weighted Regression (GWR)\nAs mentioned in our Problem Statement, GWR helps users determine significant covariates because it allows for the estimation of local regression coefficients that could vary spatially but not revealed in a global model (such as OLS)\n\nUsing Spearman Correlation Coefficient (allows us to remove insignificant variables - if \\(p < 0.05\\))\nIt is a non-parametric measure of association that does not assume a linear relationship between variables and can be useful examining the local relationships that may vary spatially. Additionally, it is not heavily influenced by outliers.\n\nEvaluation of Models\n\n10-fold cross validation - helps to estimate the model‚Äôs generalisation error. Can be used to compare the different models created by the different inputs of the users.\nVIF - helps assess multicollinearity among the predictor variables.\nMoran‚Äôs I statistic - on model‚Äôs residuals to determine if they are spatially autocorrelated.\nAIC - lower values are desired as it implies a more parsimonious model.\nAdjusted\\(R^2\\) - a larger value indicates that the model can explain a larger variance of target.variable (i.e., COVID-19 vaccination rate) and is preferred.\n\n\n\n\nThis list is not exhaustive and we might add more libraries as we design and test the analytics tool.\n\nsf - import geospatial data using approproate function(s)\nreadr - import csv files\ndplyr - to perform relation joins\nspdep - for computation of spatial weights and calculate spatially lagged variables\ntmap - for plotting cartographic quality static point pattern maps or interactive maps using leaflet API\ntidyverse - this is a collection of packages for performing data science tasks such as wrangling and visualising data\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n Credit to TeamGantt for their gantt chart template.\n\n\n\nMollalo, A., & Tatar, M.

    "text": "Today, significant amounts of land use data is both freely and commercially available for analysis. One such method explored is geographically weighted regression analysis, which considers spatial elements beyond the conventional OLS regression model, which can provide useful insights for businesses, policymakers and individuals. However, complex processes required in data preparation can hinder the effective use of spatial data to make useful conclusions. In an effort to bridge the gap between the high demand and low accessibility of this analytical tool, we aim to build an application that allows users to create geographically weighted regression models without prior technical knowledge."

    "text": "Linearity & Normality Assumption\nWhen performing multiple linear regression, it is imperative that the linearity and normality assumptions are tested. The scatterplot below (Figure 5) seeks to reveal whether there is a linear relationship between the x and y-values. If the data points are scattered around the 0 line, we can safely conclude that the relationship is linear. The histogram (Figure 6) below the scatterplot seeks to reveal the distribution of the residual of the multiple linear regression model. The report on its right helps to statistically prove the observations seen from the histogram. If the p-value of the four tests are smaller than the alpha value of 0.05, we can infer, with statistical evidence, that the residuals are not normally distributed.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Scatter Plot View of Application\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Histogram and Statistical Report to Check for Normality Assumption\n\n\nSo why is it important to check for these assumptions? Well, the linearity assumption requires that the relationship between the dependent and independent variables are linear. If the relationship is non-linear, the model‚Äôs results may be inaccurate. Which means a poor fitted model. Similarly, the normality assumption requires that the errors (i.e., residuals) of the multiple linear regression model be normally distributed. This is because if the residuals are not normally distributed, the model‚Äôs result may be inaccurate.¬†\nEssentially, this view provides a way for users to ensure the variables they have chosen will indeed be useful in generating a good model. Users are free to change the independent variables as they please to calibrate a model that works for them."

In this case, it informs whether the y-variable (i.e., vaccination_rate) varies across space. The Residual Plot (Figure 7) on the left shows whether the residuals of the linear regression model differ across the different sub-districts of DKI Jakarta. To statistically prove the observations made, the Global Moran‚Äôs I test is reported to the right of the Residual Plot. If the p-value is less than the alpha value of 0.05, we can reject the claim that the residuals are randomly distributed.
